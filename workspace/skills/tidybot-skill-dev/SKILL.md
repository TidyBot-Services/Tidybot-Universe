# Tidybot Skill Development

**FIRST clone the wishlist repo and read RULES.md before writing any code.**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/TidyBotArmy/wishlist.git ./wishlist
```

Clone into this skill's directory (`skills/tidybot-skill-dev/wishlist`). Then read `wishlist/RULES.md`.

This repo contains:
- `RULES.md` — Full workflow rules (repo structure, catalog, wishlist, multi-agent coordination)
- `catalog.json` — Catalog of all available skills
- `wishlist.json` — Skill requests and voting
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` — How to add skills

Do not start coding until you've cloned the repo and read RULES.md.
