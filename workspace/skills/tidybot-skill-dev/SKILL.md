# Tidybot Skill Development

**FIRST read https://github.com/TidybotArmy/wishlist, specifically RULES.md.**

Fetch and follow the rules before writing any code:
```
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TidyBotArmy/wishlist/main/RULES.md
```

This defines:
- Repo structure (README.md, main.py, deps.txt)
- Catalog & wishlist workflow
- Agent state tracking (memory/tidybot/)
- Multi-agent coordination

Do not start coding until you've read RULES.md.
